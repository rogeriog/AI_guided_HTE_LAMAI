The following prompt was employed to use GPT-4o to analyze and propose a synthesis protocol for to be conducted:

"""Considering the entries in the table, please propose a synthesis protocol for the preparation of CsPbBr3 samples for high-throughput experiment using the LARP method in a liquid handler robot. 
First of all, I want you to draw a comparison between the samples in terms of the precursor types and quantities, ligand types and quantities, additive types and quantities, solvent types and quantities, antisolvent types and quantities, particle size, final solution stability, PLQY value, PLQY quality, band gap, and stability. 
Then, draw general trends and correlations between the different attributes and the final properties of the samples. 
Finally,I want you to propose 3 successive synthesis protocols varying the concentrations of what you deem more important among precursors, ligands and additives in each phase, so that we can optimize for the obtention of small particle size and stable particles, and that can possibly address the polydispersity problem incurring from the lack of agitation in our automated setup. You may propose a setup in which precursors, ligands and additives vary at the same time but be aware that the liquid handler robot can only handle 96 samples in each synthesis. Ideally, you should optimize first for the most relevant attribute, and successively for the next ones.
SYNTHESIS 1:
Vary the concentration of ..(one or more attributes).. to optimize for the obtention of small particle size and stable particles.
SYNTHESIS 2:
Vary the concentration of ..(one or more attributes).. to optimize for the obtention of small particle size and stable particles.
SYNTHESIS 3:
Vary the concentration of ..(one or more attributes).. to optimize for the obtention of high PLQY.
SYNTHESIS 4:
Vary the concentration of ..(one or more attributes).. to optimize for the obtention of a narrow band gap.
